# Write your solution here
# Please write a function named double_items(numbers: list), which takes a list of integers as its argument.

# The function should return a new list, which contains all values from the original list doubled. The function should not change the original list.

# An example of the function at work:


def double_items(numbers: list):

    new_list = []

    for item in numbers:

        new_list.append(item * 2)
    return new_list



if __name__ == "__main__":
    numbers = [2, 4, 5, 3, 11, -4]
    numbers_doubled = double_items(numbers)
    print("original:", numbers)
    print("doubled:", numbers_doubled)
